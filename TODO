DONE:
- REWRITE in OS API (posix, windows, maybe macos?)

TEST UCRT with arguments with spaces and quotes
- Write WinAPI bindings
- replace stdin/out/err file strings with plain pipes in execute_cmd
- add functions for creating and manipulating pipes
- rewrite get_current_executable_path to support all oses (no /proc on e.g. BSD) maybe just canonize argv[0]?
- maybe linux refactor
- code todos
- try to break (e.g. set all arguments to NULL, 0 or empty array or string)
- Do something about warning, error, todo (Logging system but with exits like error?)
- Add compiler and other stuff to create_clangd_settings
- Incremental build (function for checking if file needs to be rebuilt)
